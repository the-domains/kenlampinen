            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's time to have a serious discussion about whether Harrison Ford is immortal. After all, news broke Tuesday that the actor will star in a fifth "Indiana Jones" movie, set for release in 2019.  At age 73, and with a frickin' plane crash very near in his rearview mirror, Ford continues to crush it at a pace that would likely break many younger stars. He's not only resurrecting the most iconic and adventurous archaeologist in cinema history. He's also coming off a blockbuster reprisal of the role that made his name, in "Star Wars: The Force Awakens," and is starring in a very long-awaited "Blade Runner" sequel.  In a statement, Disney said: "Indiana Jones will return to the big screen on July 19, 2019, for a fifth epic adventure in the blockbuster series. Steven Spielberg, who directed all four previous films, will helm the as-yet-untitled project with star Harrison Ford reprising his iconic role. Franchise veterans Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall will produce."</p>]]></description>
