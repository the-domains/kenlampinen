    newspapers, independent publishers and even bloggers, expanding the amount of content you'll be able to read on your iPhone, according to media reports on Tuesday. The News app, which is baked into the iOS software that powers iPhones and iPads, aggregates
    news sources into one feed and builds personalized recommendations based on what you read. Apple has partnered with more than 100 media companies since launching the app in September, including The New York Times, Conde Nast and (full disclosure)
    CNET. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The expansion is part of Apple's battle with rivals, including Facebook and Google, to capture more of your mobile attention by delivering content quickly. Next month, Facebook is opening
    Instant Articles, which accelerates the loading of news stories posted to the social network, to all publishers. Google has a similar project called AMP, which stands for Accelerated Mobile Pages. The company says AMP pages load four times faster
    and take up less wireless data than a regular article page. Apple is also promising to make it easier for publishers to see how articles are performing in the News app, according to the reports. In October, CEO Tim Cook said around 40 million people
    were using Apple News. However, the company later admitted it didn't know exactly how many people were reading articles on the app. Apple had been underestimating the number of readers due to a software bug, Apple executive Eddy Cue told the The Wall
    Street Journal.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="22"><div class="Attribution op-60 " data-reactid="23"><h5 data-reactid="24"><span class="Author f-s-xxs " data-reactid="25"><a href="http://www.cnet.com">cnet.com</a></span></h5></div></div></section><section id="section-h_GraphicalColumn-1a582f0e-85f1-48fa-bfa7-1dba8203622c" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="26"><div class="Component ls-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="27"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-50p w-100p ls-w-50p" data-reactid="28"><a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/harrison-ford-2-0-continues-to-roll-with-upcoming-indiana-jones-flick-in-2019/" class=" " data-reactid="29"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="30"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="31"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/38988caddcbd0b8592e045937dbf9fd9/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fb5fec194f99127473d498b39edf78ededfbc33c3.jpg&amp;width=970" style="object-position:54.38144329896907% 43.654434250764524%;" data-reactid="32"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/38988caddcbd0b8592e045937dbf9fd9/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fb5fec194f99127473d498b39edf78ededfbc33c3.jpg&amp;width=970" style="object-position:54.38144329896907% 43.654434250764524%;" data-reactid="33"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/ac2fc4d0960c6b86fe07d6f61109c033/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fb5fec194f99127473d498b39edf78ededfbc33c3.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:54.38144329896907% 43.654434250764524%;" data-reactid="34"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/6bb9b1189edaab42b167e9ea96a93170/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fb5fec194f99127473d498b39edf78ededfbc33c3.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:54.38144329896907% 43.654434250764524%;" data-reactid="35"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="970" data-height="654" data-ratio="1.4831804281345566" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/38988caddcbd0b8592e045937dbf9fd9/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fb5fec194f99127473d498b39edf78ededfbc33c3.jpg&amp;width=970" style="object-position:54.38144329896907% 43.654434250764524%;" data-reactid="36"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title fx-b-50p" data-reactid="37"><!-- react-empty: 38 --><!-- react-empty: 39 --><!-- react-empty: 40 --><div class="Attribution op-60 " data-reactid="41"><h5 data-reactid="42"><span class="Author f-s-xxs " data-reactid="43"><a href="http://www.cnet.com">cnet.com</a></span></h5></div><!-- react-empty: 44 --><div class="Paragraph ls-t-a-j" data-reactid="45"><p>It's time to have a serious discussion about whether Harrison Ford is immortal. After all, news broke Tuesday that the actor will star in a fifth "Indiana Jones" movie, set for release in 2019.  At age 73, and with a frickin' plane crash very near in his rearview mirror, Ford continues to crush it at a pace that would likely break many younger stars. He's not only resurrecting the most iconic and adventurous archaeologist in cinema history. He's also coming off a blockbuster reprisal of the role that made his name, in "Star Wars: The Force Awakens," and is starring in a very long-awaited "Blade Runner" sequel.  In a statement, Disney said: "Indiana Jones will return to the big screen on July 19, 2019, for a fifth epic adventure in the blockbuster series. Steven Spielberg, who directed all four previous films, will helm the as-yet-untitled project with star Harrison Ford reprising his iconic role. Franchise veterans Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall will produce."</p></div></div></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="46"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="47"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="48"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="49"><span data-reactid="50"><!-- react-empty: 51 --><h2 data-reactid="52"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="53">kenlampinen</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="54"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="55"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="56"></div></div></div></section></div></div>

The News app, which is baked into the iOS software that powers iPhones and iPads, aggregates news sources into one feed and builds personalized recommendations based on what you read. Apple has partnered with more than 100 media companies since launching the app in September, including The New York Times, Conde Nast and (full disclosure) CNET.  Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The expansion is part of Apple's battle with rivals, including Facebook and Google, to capture more of your mobile attention by delivering content quickly. Next month, Facebook is opening Instant Articles, which accelerates the loading of news stories posted to the social network, to all publishers.  Google has a similar project called AMP, which stands for Accelerated Mobile Pages. The company says AMP pages load four times faster and take up less wireless data than a regular article page.  Apple is also promising to make it easier for publishers to see how articles are performing in the News app, according to the reports. In October, CEO Tim Cook said around 40 million people were using Apple News. However, the company later admitted it didn't know exactly how many people were reading articles on the app.  Apple had been underestimating the number of readers due to a software bug, Apple executive Eddy Cue told the The Wall Street Journal.","_html":"<p>Apple News aggregates news sources into one feed and builds personalized recommendations based on what you read.
